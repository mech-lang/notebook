# Installation

If you want to install Mech on your computer you can download a binary pre-compiled for your system, or you can build Mech from source. As always, you can use Mech online at <a href="try.mech-lang.org">try.mech-lang.org</a>

## Build From Source

You can find the source code for Mech at our <a href="https://github.com/mech-lang/mech">GitHub repository</a>. Before you can build the project, you will first need to install <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started">Rust</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a> for your platform.

Then, clone the Mech repository and follow these build instructions:

```
> git clone https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/mech
> cd mech
> git submodule update --init --recursive
> cd notebook
> npm install
> cd..
> cargo build --bin mech --release
```

Alternatively, you can use Rust's Cargo build system to build Mech. Note: This method will not build the Mech Notebook, which runs on Node.

```
> cargo install -g mech
```
